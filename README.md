#### Chat-Application with Socket.IO
HTML based chat application with using Socket.IO.

#### What's next?
Here are some ideas to improve the application:

- Broadcast a message to connected users when someone connects or disconnects
- Add support for nicknames
- Don’t send the same message to the user that sent it himself. Instead, append the message directly as soon as he presses enter.
- Add “{user} is typing” functionality
- Show who’s online
- Add private messaging
- Share your improvements!
